These are slides, notes and references from my talk at the 2014 MIMA Summit. 

You can download a PDF of the slides [here](https://github.com/ericdodds/2014-mima-summit-presentation/blob/master/2014-mima-summit-slides-eric-dodds-tomorrows-developers.pdf).

Also, just for fun, here's a screen recording of me actually creating this repo. The total time was ~50 minutes, but the video is sped up to show the entire process in ~2:45.

### Slide 18

> "Every software engineer has experienced a job interview in which he or she was forced to act more like a dictionary than a human being. There's a prevalent misconception that, in order to properly develop software, one must know all the minute details of any programming language listed in the job requirements. It's a remnant of the days when developers received their knowledge from physical manuals."

This quote is by Blake Callens in an article published on Exit Event. You can [read the full article here](http://exitevent.com/article/software-talent-isnt-that-hard-to-find-14825).

### Slide 19

This is a screenshot from Wikipedia's [Alphabetical List of Programming Languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages).

### Slide 20

> ...if you look at just about any Facebook job posting for an engineer, you’ll see a B.A. or M.A. in computer science listed as a “requirement.”

> It isn’t, according to Serkan Piantino, who leads Facebook’s New York office.
“Part of our recruiting strategy is to be pretty agnostic to the things that don’t matter,” Piantino told Quartz in an interview earlier this summer. 

> “Things like somebody’s prior background, whether they went to a top [computer science] program or never graduated high school, if they’re a good fit for Facebook we just try to focus on that.”

These quotes come from a Quartz article on how many requirements listed in job postings are fictitious or should be ignored. You can read the full article [on Quartz's website](http://qz.com/255565/job-requirements-are-mostly-fiction-and-you-should-ignore-them/). 

### Slide 22

> "Job opportunities for web developers are expected to be good. Those with knowledge of multiple programming languages and digital multimedia tools...will have the best opportunities.”

This quote is from a BLS Occupational Outlook for Web Development. You can read the full report [on the BLS website](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm#tab-6).

### Slide 25

The original version of this diagram of programming languages can be found on [http://rigaux.org/](http://rigaux.org/language-study/diagram.pdf).

### Slide 31

> I'm not sure I would say my grasp of languages/tools are what make me valuable, but more that I have a set of patterns and mental models that 1) allow me to learn new things quickly and 2) allow me to synthesize different topics into one coherent whole.

This quote is from Iron Yard Instructor Jake Smith. You can [follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacobthemyth).

### Slide 32

> ￼Learn tools, and use tools, but don't accept tools. Always distrust them; always be alert for alternative ways of thinking. This is what I mean by avoiding the conviction that you "know what you're doing".

This quote is from Bret Victor in commentary about his presentation called "The Future of Programming." You can watch the presentation and find the original quote [on his website](http://worrydream.com/dbx/).

### Slide 35

> Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.

This definition of Open-source software is from Wikipedia's [article on the same subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). 

### Slide 36

This chart is from a 2008 paper written about open source software from Amit Deshpande and Dirk Riehle of SAP Labs. You can read the full paper [here](http://dirkriehle.com/publications/2008-2/the-total-growth-of-open-source/).

### Slide 38

This graph is from a report from Black Duck Software on the future of open source. You can see the full presentation [on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/blackducksoftware/the-2013-future-of-open-source-survey-results).

### Slide 40

> I would say that with closed source tools, it's really hard learn from them. I can only use them. Whereas, with open source (Rails, Ember, Angular, whatever), I am able to look at their source code and learn from people much better than me.

This quote is from Iron Yard Instructor Jesse Wolgamott. You can learn more about him [on The Iron Yard's website](http://theironyard.com/about/team/#jesse) and [follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jwo). 

### Slide 41

> Closed source communities are divided between those that create the tools, and those that use the tools. In open-source, they're basically the same community. So I can get to know the person who wrote this code.

This quote is from Iron Yard Instructor Jesse Wolgamott. You can learn more about him [on The Iron Yard's website](http://theironyard.com/about/team/#jesse) and [follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jwo).

### Slide 68

> If you understand code, you strengthen your ability to act as a valuable liaison, no matter what your role. It makes you a valuable asset if you’re working within a company, and a stronger leader if you’re building your own. You will also remain empowered when hiring and managing developers or outsourcing efforts. Because you are familiar with the same tools they are, you will know what is feasible, what is efficient, and the true level of effort for any task.

This quote is from a blog post called "4 Reasons to Code Your Website, Even Though There's Squarespace." You can read the full article [on General Assembly's blog](http://blog.generalassemb.ly/4-reasons-to-learn-code-even-though-theres-squarespace/).
